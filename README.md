## 🆕 Adding New Tasks
1. **Type your task** in the box at the top (like "Buy pizza ingredients" 🍕)
2. **Pick a priority**:
   - 🔴 High: "OMG do this now!" tasks
   - 🟡 Medium: "Should do soon" tasks
   - 🟢 Low: "Whenever you feel like it" tasks
3. Hit **"Add Task"** and watch it appear in your list!

## ✅ Completing Tasks
- Check the box ✔️ next to tasks you've completed
- Hit **"Delete Selected"** to clear them out 

## 🌈 Colorful Priority System
Your tasks dress up in different colors so you can spot important stuff at a glance:
- 🔥 **Red** = High priority (Do this first!)
- ⚡ **Yellow** = Medium priority (Get to it soon)
- 🍃 **Green** = Low priority (Chill tasks)

## 💾 Automatic Saving Magic
Your tasks are automatically saved to a file on your 'Desktop' called "TO-DO TASKS!.txt" - they'll still be there even if you close the app!

## Pro Tips 💡
